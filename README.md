# algo

A personal collection of algorithm practice problems, data structures, and experimental Rust implementations.

## ✨ What's in here

- **Solutions** to various algorithmic problems — primarily from LeetCode — with first-pass implementations written solo.
- Follow-up iterations with optimizations guided by research or discussions (e.g., GPT, documentation, articles), but always understood and re-implemented, not copied.
- Custom-built data structures in `src/` like:
  - `list.rs`, `stack.rs`, `deque.rs`: exploring classic structures
  - `tree.rs`: basic tree from scratch (stopped before diving into `unsafe`)
  - `memory.rs`: initial experiments with manual layout understanding
