1. Objectives (Output-Oriented Goals)

    Substack/blog post every X weeks (summarizing a concept/project)
    Polish & ship 1 project/month (even a small tool/demo)
    Resume/portfolio-friendly repo grooming

2. Definite Progress Points

    LeetCode Hard Fluency by June 15
    Numerical / ML / Math Projects by June 30
    Rust systems internals (e.g., ownership/memory/async) deeper by July

3. Practice & Implementation

    Daily DSA (1‚Äì2 hards, 2‚Äì3 mediums)
    Weekly mini project or concept recreation (e.g., build Arc/Rc, LRU cache, memory arena)

4. Deep Learning Blocks

    Read 1 whitepaper/text section per week (track key insights)
    Implement 1 core algorithm/system per week from scratch (e.g., FFT, backprop, async runtime skeleton)

5. Context Fluency (Recall & Reasoning)

    Weekly quiz: L1/L2/L3 times, async vs sync, Arc vs Rc, trait bounds, ownership, hashmap layout, etc.
    Spaced repetition / flashcards (optional but potent)
    10-min recap logs: ‚ÄúWhat I understood this week‚Äù

//üîπ 1. Numerical Stability & Floating Point
    // IEEE-754, error propagation, Kahan summation
    // Matrix condition numbers, stability of ops like QR/SVD
    // When to use fixed-point or arbitrary precision
    // Why it matters: You‚Äôre building tools that manipulate math. Understanding rounding error and representational quirks separates black-box ML from real tool-building.
// üîπ 4. Compilers / DSLs / Codegen
// üîπ 5. Control Theory & Signal Processing
