1. Objectives (Output-Oriented Goals)

    Substack/blog post every X weeks (summarizing a concept/project)

    Polish & ship 1 project/month (even a small tool/demo)

    Resume/portfolio-friendly repo grooming

2. Definite Progress Points

    LeetCode Hard Fluency by June 15

    Numerical / ML / Math Projects by June 30

    Rust systems internals (e.g., ownership/memory/async) deeper by July

3. Practice & Implementation

    Daily DSA (1–2 hards, 2–3 mediums)

    Weekly mini project or concept recreation (e.g., build Arc/Rc, LRU cache, memory arena)

4. Deep Learning Blocks

    Read 1 whitepaper/text section per week (track key insights)

    Implement 1 core algorithm/system per week from scratch (e.g., FFT, backprop, async runtime skeleton)

5. Context Fluency (Recall & Reasoning)

    Weekly quiz: L1/L2/L3 times, async vs sync, Arc vs Rc, trait bounds, ownership, hashmap layout, etc.

    Spaced repetition / flashcards (optional but potent)

    10-min recap logs: “What I understood this week”
